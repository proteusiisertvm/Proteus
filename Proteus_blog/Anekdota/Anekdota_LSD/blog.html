          The psychedelic drug lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was first synthesized on November 16, 1938 by the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann in the Sandoz (now Novartis) laboratories in Basel, Switzerland. It was not until five years later on April 19, 1943, that the psychedelic properties were found.
          <br><br>

Albert Hofmann was a co-worker with professor Arthur Stoll, founder and director of the pharmaceutical department at Sandoz laboratories. His work had him studying the chemical structure of Scilla glycosides. These glycosides were the active principle of the Mediterranean Squill. His work along with the study of the compounds structure involved purifying and synthesizing the active compounds in these to develop pharmaceutical compounds. In his research, Hofmann on November 16th, 1938 first synthesized LSD with the intention of discovering an analeptic. Analeptics are respiratory and circulatory stimulants. Post discovery, this new drug was shelved for the next 5 years, until April 16th, 1943 when Hofmann decided to give it a second look. This involved re-synthesis of the then analeptic drug. In this process, he accidently absorbed a small amount of the drug. This allowed him to discover the powerful effects of this drug which he described as:

“... affected by a remarkable restlessness, combined with a slight dizziness. At home I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated-like condition, characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination. In a dreamlike state, with eyes closed (I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring), I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors. After about two hours this condition faded away.”
<br><br>
Affected by his first accident, on April 19th of the same year Hoffman performed a self-experiment to determine the true effects of LSD. He ingested 0.25mg of the substance in this attempt. This was what he predicted as the threshold dose for human consumption, later it was determined that the actual threshold was a 100 fold less - at 0.02mg.
<br><br>
In this self experiment, it took less than an hour for Hoffman to feel the effects of LSD. He had to ask his laboratory assistant to escort him home. In those times, travelling was done primarily by bicycle. On the way home, Hoffman’s condition began rapidly deteriorating as he began getting bouts of anxiety and hallucinations that his next-door neighbour was a malevolent witch, that he was going insane, and that the LSD had poisoned him. Upon inspection by a house doctor, who explained that there were no physical abnormalities and that he was completely fine, except for extremely dilated pupils. This sense of reassurance allowed Hoffman to relax and a new sense enjoyment began to engulf him which he describes as:
"...little by little I could begin to enjoy the unprecedented colors and plays of shapes that persisted behind my closed eyes. Kaleidoscopic, fantastic images surged in on me, alternating, variegated, opening and then closing themselves in circles and spirals, exploding in colored fountains, rearranging and hybridizing themselves in constant flux..."
<br><br>
This first ever LSD consumption or trip is now known as Bicycle Day as the bicycle trip home was what proved to Hoffman the significant psychedelic potency of this drug. Hoffman foresaw the drug as a powerful psychiatric tool due to its introspective nature. Although he couldn't imagine anyone using it recreationally.
