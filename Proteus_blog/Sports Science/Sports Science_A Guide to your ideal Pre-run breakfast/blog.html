          It's almost race day, and if you are one of the majority who worries over what and when to eat before your race, you are at the right place. 
          <br><br>
          It would be best for athletes to have a personal go-to menu for a pre-run breakfast and the meals for a week leading up to it. Nutrition on race-day is essential because too much or the wrong diet can cause gut issues, and too little food can result in exhaustion setting in early. And on the topic of energy, let's start with the age-old tactic of runners, especially the long-distance ones, to have a carbohydrate-only breakfast to fuel the entire run. 
          <br><br>
          <img src="images/A1.png" alt="picture">
          <h3> Carbs are king</h3>
         Why? The body needs glucose to run on, i.e., the glycogen stores in the liver are the energy reservoir. However, this glycogen reservoir is depleted chiefly overnight. So for maximised performance, we must replenish our body with carbohydrates. For athletes with a carbs-only breakfast, some of it may end up as muscle glycogen. Given that, the building up of muscle glycogen should be gradually built up during the week leading up to the race.
         <br><br>
         When it comes to the amount and timing of intake of carbohydrates, everyone's tolerance levels are bound to be different. So there is no ideal carbohydrate breakfast, and instead, it must be tailored to individual preferences. Having said that, oatmeal, porridge, and granola bars are the most popular carbohydrate-heavy breakfast recommendations. 
         <br><br>
         Of course, every runner is different. There are exceptions to every rule: the 100-mile champion and prodigal marathoner Zach Bitter eats almost no carbs and usually eats just enough proteins not to get hungry.
         <br><br>
         <img src="images/A2.png" alt="picture">
         <h3> Pinch of protein </h3>
         Other athletes prefer to add protein to their carbs-heavy breakfast, which is usually simple and easy to digest. Many athletes add protein powder not just to their pre-race breakfast but also to their regular menu. 
         <br><br>
         Incidentally, a significant number of runners avoid dairy on the day. Dairy is exceptionally high in protein, and too much of it may cause cramping or tiredness. This is also the reason for limiting protein intake in the week leading up to the event. 
         <br><br>
         Popular protein choices include protein pancakes and peanut butter.
         <img src="images/A3.png" alt="picture">
         <h3> Just liquids, please. </h3>
         <br><br>
         For some athletes, getting jitters on race day is accompanied by an aversion to the intake of solids. Rather than just for them but also for regular runners, meal replacers are significantly gaining popularity. Nutrisystem and Beachbody are two such branded meal shakes. Today, Olympic athletes are permitted to enjoy a cup of coffee before competing, and a few opt for just that instead of a full meal. There are quite a few individuals in running communities who swear by bullet coffee: coffee with butter and coconut oil. This concoction is popular for the improved metabolism, brain function and better gut health that it brings about. So yes, going with just liquids is also a viable option, albeit one slightly doubted by puritan dieticians. If liquid nutrition usually works for you, feel free to follow through on race day with the same.
         <img src="images/A4.png" alt="picture">
         <h3> Is fasted running faster? </h3>
         A fasted run is when you have only water or a cup of coffee before running. The goal of a fasted run is to take fat from cells and put it into the bloodstream. This is possible since the lowered glycogen levels signal the fat stores to provide the fuel instead. Obviously, this is more of a long-term workout style suited for a few—athletes looking to lose weight or athletes with gastrointestinal issues—and it isn't for everyone. Still, a few athletes out there are trying out the benefits of fasted running for an actual race after regular practice. 
         <br><br>
         Verdict: Proceed with caution. Do not test out a fasted run on race day unless you are well used to it.
         <br><br>
         <h3> To eat or not to eat </h3>
         Having something as your pre-run meal should not be based on whether it is healthy. Sure, meat and eggs usually are a part of a healthy diet. But meat, especially breakfast meats like sausage, has a high fat content, which takes longer to digest and may even cause stomach cramps. The same goes for eggs. Save these for after the race.
         <br><br>
         <h3> Try. It. Out.</h3>
         As always, practice is key. Not just when it comes to the actual sport, but to breakfast too. Any new diet or meal you have been hearing so much about and want to try out? Go ahead. But never on race day. Instead, test it out in your usual routine for a couple of weeks while noting any discomfort or deviancies from your usual stats. Once satisfied, you can include that as your regular breakfast before runs. 
         <br><br>
         Having a carefully chosen breakfast tailored to your tastes is a great way to keep you ready and perfectly set for your race.
         <br><br>
         Bon appetit and kill the run!
