        <p class="article">
          One of the most prominent adaptations to training is a change in skeletal muscle substrate metabolism.
          Often, endurance training (ET) when compared to high-intensity sprint interval training (SIT) is described
          to have a higher effect on muscle oxidative capacity, substrate utilization and endurance performance. This
          unique experiment was to compare changes in exercise capacity and molecular and cellular adaptations in
          skeletal muscle after low-volume SIT and high-volume ET which had never been done before.
          <br><br>
          The protocol taken up in the experiment was to recruit sixteen healthy men from McMaster University who
          generally took up recreational exercise, two to three weeks prior to the experiment. None of the men were
          engaged in regular sport specific training. The men were randomly separated into two groups to undergo SIT
          and ET training respectively.
          <br><br>
          <span style="font-size:1.4rem">Pre-Experimental Procedures</span>
          <br>
          To acclimatise the subjects to the experimental procedures of training and testing, several
          pre-experimental procedures were taken up. These included the following:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Subjects were made familiar with the laboratory in order to become orientated with the testing
              procedures and training devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              During one of these visits, subjects performed an incremental test to exhaustion on an electronically
              braked cycle in order to determine VO2 peak using an online gas collection system.
            </li>
            <li>
              All subjects also performed a 50kJ time trial and 750kJ time trial in order to become familiarized
              with the exercise tests employed during the main experimental trials. In a time trial subjects were
              instructed to complete 50 and 750 kJ self-paced laboratory time trials on an electronically braked
              cycle ergometer as quickly as possible with no temporal, verbal or physiological feedback. The only
              feedback provided during the time trials was presented as ‘distance covered’ on a computer monitor.
              In the experiment, 50 kJ was equated to 2 km, and 750 kJ was equated to 30 km. Exercise duration and
              average power were recorded upon completion of each test
            </li>
            <li>
              Subjects in the SIT group also performed a familiarization Wingate test, and subjects in the ET group
              performed a submaximal exercise test to determine the workload that elicited ∼65% VO2 peak. A Wingate
              test is a test wherein Subjects in the SIT group completed a 30s maximal effort on an electronically
              braked cycle ergometer at a resistance equivalent to 7.5% of their body mass. The ergometer was
              interfaced with a computer containing software that applied the appropriate load for each subject.
              Subjects were instructed to begin pedalling as fast as possible ∼2 s before the computer applied the
              load and received extensive verbal encouragement throughout the test. Peak power, mean power and
              fatigue index were calculated and recorded by an online data acquisition system.
            </li>
            <i>
              Note: All exercise tests performed during the familiarization period were performed on days
              separated by at least 24 h, and at least 3 days prior to baseline testing.
            </i>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          <span style="font-size:1.4rem">Experimental protocol</span>
          <br>
          The experimental protocol consisted of:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Baseline testing
            </li>
            <li>
              Two-week training intervention
            </li>
            <li>
              Post-training procedures.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          <span style="font-size:1.13rem"><i>Baseline Testing</i></span>
          <br>
          <p class="p1">
            Prior to training, all subjects underwent a resting needle muscle biopsy procedure. Here, a tissue sample
            from the vastus lateralis muscle was obtained. The muscle sample was immediately frozen in liquid
            nitrogen after removal from the leg. After this, two performance tests were taken up by all sixteen
            subjects. This was a 50kJ time trial an hour after the procedure and another 750kJ time trial two days
            after the procedure.
          </p>
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          <span style="font-size:1.13rem"><i>Training (Two Days After the 750kJ Time Trial)</i></span>
          <p class="p1">
            This consisted of six sessions spread over 14 days, including 1 or 2 days recovery between training
            sessions. Both groups performed training on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for 2 weeks.
            <ul>
              <li style="margin-left:2em">
                For the SIT group, training consisted of repeated 30 s maximal cycling efforts, interspersed with 4
                min of recovery. The training progressed by increasing the number of repeats from four repetitions
                during sessions 1 and 2, to five repetitions during sessions 3 and 4, and finally to six repetitions
                during sessions 5 and 6.
              </li>
              <li style="margin-left:2em">
                For the ET group, training consisted of 90–120 min of continuous cycling. Training progressed by
                increasing the duration of exercise from 90 min during sessions 1 and 2, to 105 min during sessions
                3 and 4, and finally to 120 min during sessions 5 and 6.
              </li>
            </ul>

        <p class="article">
          <span style="font-size:1.13rem"><i>Post-Training Procedures</i></span>
          <p class="p1">
            The nature and timing of the post-training tests was the same as the pre-training procedures. During the
            experiments, subjects were allowed to continue their normal dietary and physical activity practices
            throughout the experiment, however, they were instructed to refrain from any exercise aside from
            activities of daily living and were even instructed to consume the same types and quantities of food for
            two days prior to the biopsy procedures and exercise performance tests. Subjects completed food diaries
            prior to the baseline biopsy and performance tests. They were replicated before the post training
            procedures.
            <br><br>
            On the muscle tissue the following tests were conducted:
            <ul>
              <li style="margin-left:2em">
                The maximal activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) was determined on a spectrophotometer.

              <li style="margin-left:2em">
                Protein content of the muscle homogenate was determined.
              </li>

                Enzyme activity was calculated in mol (kg protein) −1 h−1.
              </li>
              <li style="margin-left:2em">
                The amounts of COX subunit II (mitochondrial encoded) and COX subunit IV (nuclear encoded) were
                quantified using Western blotting.

              <li style="margin-left:2em">

              </li>
              <li style="margin-left:2em">
                The in vitro method of determining Muscle Buffering Capacity was taken up. This was calculated in μmol
                H+ (g dry muscle) −1 pH unit−1.
              </li>
              <li style="margin-left:2em">
                Muscle glycogen was also measured
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          <span style="font-size:1.4rem">Findings</span>
          <br>
          When muscle oxidative capacity and muscle buffering capacity were analysed, these tests were made to
          analyse exercise tolerance. The results from these studies were equivocal, and reported similar increases
          in the maximal activities of mitochondrial enzymes after interval and continuous training.
          <br><br>
          Training was seen to induce an increase in the maximal activity of COX and the protein contents of COX
          subunits II and IV, but there were no differences between groups despite the marked differences in training
          volume. However, with the increase in the content of these proteins that showed an increase in the number
          of mitochondria, there was no increase in the mRNA content in the muscle.
          <br><br>
          To conclude, the present study took two very diverse forms of training and reported that they induced
          remarkably similar changes in exercise capacity and selected muscle adaptations that are related to
          exercise tolerance. The SIT group took up markedly lower training volume and the results suggest that
          intense interval training is indeed a time-efficient strategy to induce rapid muscle and performance
          adaptations comparable to traditional endurance training.
          <br><br>
          Note that the article discusses that additional research would be necessary to clarify the effect of different
          acute exercise ‘impulses’ on molecular signalling events in the human skeletal muscle, and the precise time
          course and mechanisms responsible for the contraction-induced changes that facilitate the training adaptation.
          These were some events that were not analysed in the article.
          <br><br>
          What do you think the analysis would result in?
