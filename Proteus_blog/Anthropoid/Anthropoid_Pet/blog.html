          We have pets. We love our pets! But in this anthropoid we explore how animals too have their own animal companions! Can we call these pets? Let us know in the comments.
          There are several examples of animals all around the world that have formed masterful relationships with other species. However, unlike us with our cats and dogs, these mutualistic creature companionships are usually essential for both animals’ well being, if not their very survival. It’s time to dive into some examples.
          <br><br>
          <b>Tarantulas and frogs</b>
          <br>
          The Colombian lesserblack tarantula is a large species of spider that preys on many smaller living creatures in its habitats, including smaller frogs. Despite this, many spiders let these frogs live and keep them as pets. These pet frogs eat ants, which are known to impact spider fitness by eating their eggs. This protection to the spider eggs is what allows the spiders to keep the frogs croaking. A bonus to this relationship between spiders and frogs is that the spiders also protect the tadpoles of their “pet frogs”.
          <br><br>
          <b>Deer and monkeys</b>
          <br>
          Another similar but slightly confusing example of animal pets belongs to the pair of the Sika deer and the red-bottomed macaque monkeys. The animals often live happily together on the Japanese island Yakushima. In this relationship the pet and the owner relationship is not black and white but grey. The monkeys are seen to ride on the deer's back playfully but at the same time it is known that the deers gain from the relationship by listening to the macaques feeding call to obtain nutrition from the endemic camphor trees.
          <br><br>
          <b>Remoras and sharks</b>
          <br>
          Sharks and remoras are tropical ocean dwelling marine animals. A very common sight in magnificent pictures of sharks is the remora sucker fish hanging on and gaining transportation, protection and nutrition, giving nothing back in return. However, sharks benefit greatly from these sucker fishes as these fishes help them remove dead skin and parasites that latch on.
          <br><br>
          <b>Keyhole limpets and scale worms</b>
          <br>
          This super duo of underwater creatures form an incredibly effective bond. Limpets are underwater snails that employ the protection of these banded scale worms as guard dogs to protect them. These worms live inside the limpet shell and attack any predator of the snail by biting the attacker with their fangs!
          <br><br>
          <b>Oxpeckers and cows</b>
          <br>
          Oxpeckers are exactly what they are called. They peck at oxes, buffalos and other large mammals, feeding on the bugs and insects on them. These birds live in the mammals' hair by creating their nests there too. These facts are clear and obvious, here’s the catch though, once oxpeckers get a taste for the host's blood, they begin pecking on the animal wounds for a bloody snack! This is something that the mammals usually put up with.
          <br><br>
          <b>Ants and Aphids</b>
          <br>
          Aphids are common sucking insects that feed on plant sap and secrete a sweet secretion called honeydew. This is a favourite to many ants and for this reason, ants are often seen farming honeydew from aphids. They actually “milk” aphids by stroking their abdomen. At the same time, aphids are provided protection from their predators by ants. This cattle like pet relationship is very common among many ant and aphid species. Anytime you see a large number of ants on a tree or plant, it is likely you have a large infestation of aphids.
          <br><br>
          <b>Gorillas and cats</b>
          <br>
          Koko the celebrity gorilla is known to be incredibly intelligent with knowledge of more than 1000 signs. Despite her immense brain, her most anthropoid-like characteristic is her love for kitties! Koko requested a pet cat on her birthday in 1985. She named the grey male Manx cat All-Ball. All-Ball did not live for long and met with an accident, resulting in a grieving Koko which demonstrates the strength of their bond. The next year Koko received two more kittens, Lipstick and Smokey.
          <br><br>
          <b>Elephant and Dogs</b>
          <br>
          Tarra is an elephant from the Tennessee Elephant Sanctuary. And she has an adorable pet dog named Bella. Bella used to be a stray that wandered onto the sanctuary. Tarra welcomed the dog in her home and began to spend more time with it than her peers. The bond between this cinematic pair was clear as day when Bella received a spinal injury that left her bed ridden with the loss in function of her legs. The entire time, as the medical team on the ground were treating Bella indoors, Tarra stood vigil outside the building, refusing to leave Bella's side.
