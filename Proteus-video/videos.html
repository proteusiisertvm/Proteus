          Dear students and my dear faculty colleagues of the school of Biology, for some time now, the school of Biology wanted to have a Biology club. Today I'm going to introduce our biology club named Proteus. The club is comprised of 11
          members for the time being, including Biology major students, BS-MS students, IPh.D., and Ph.D. students of the SoB. The club has planned many exciting and interesting activities weekly, monthly and fortnightly activities. These
          activities will be informed to you by the club very soon. This club will be all about discussing, learning, and promoting Sciences, especially biological sciences. We have discussed to make the activities and contributors to these
          activities to be age and valiant, and gender-balanced. I request your full support to make this a successful and interesting place to be.
          Thank you all very much.
        </p>

          A broader outlook for all sciences and a holistic perspective of the chosen discipline are
          much-needed attributes for the present day higher education that  is connate with interdisciplinarity.
          In this digital age, I am sure the space such as this will allow budding as well as seasoned professionals
          to engage mutually and indulge in constructive enrichment.  I wish ‘Proteus’ all the best in serving as a
          source of veritable information and state-of-the-art knowledge!

          While the COVID-19 pandemic has forced the students indoors, away from campus, our students
          used the time to envisage this biology club: Proteus. I believe that this club has the potential
          to nurture scientific curiosity and reasoning among young brains, who possess a genuine enthusiasm
          to learn. The club opens opportunities, outside the classroom, from learning directly from scientists
          involved in discoveries to engaging in real-world science research and education. The club will also
          help in nurturing long-term academic relationships between club members and practising scientists in
          India and abroad. I wish the club all the best in their endeavours in making school a more fulfilling
          experience, and in inculcating a scientific temperament in the wider community.

          Proteus has been doing a great job in showcasing the wide range of research taking place
          at the School of Biology. This platform has bought together- the dynamism of budding
          scientists and the perspective of seasoned researchers. I congratulate the group and look
          forward to more successful events.
