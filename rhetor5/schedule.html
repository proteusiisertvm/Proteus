                              Shola ecosystems are found on geographically isolated, high-elevation regions of
the Western Ghats, forming a “Sky-island” system. Despite their isolation, their
matrix of montane grasslands and evergreen forests harbour disproportionately
more endemic taxa of birds, plants, fishes and invertebrates. Both habitats, forests
and grasslands have endemic birds that are restricted to specific mountains. <br> <a target="_blank" href="" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#Modal1">Read more </a>

                             Stem cells are the basic unit of development. The uniqueness of stem cells resides in their potential to self-renew and differentiate into a wide array of cell types.
                            My group’s interest lies in the exploration of the molecular basis of cell commitment and differentiation into various lineages using both the murine and the human pluripotent stem cells as the model system. Our target is to delineate the molecular basis underlying various lineages prior- and subsequent to the lineage commitment and specification - the key drivers that direct the uncommitted cells to choose a specific cell fate during early development. <br> <a target="_blank" href="" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#Modal1">Read more </a>

                            differentially regulate recombination and chromosomal
                            segregation</h3>
                          <p class="description">
                            Cohesin complexes are ring-shaped multimers that serve a multitude of functions,
                            such as regulating genome architecture, transcription, and DNA repair, apart from
                            their canonical roles in chromosomal segregation fidelity during cell division. Paralogs
                            exist for a few subunits of this complex, which if co-expressed, can result in the
                            presence of multiple complexes at the same time in a cell. Meiotic chromosomes
                            contain two distinct cohesin complexes, one specifically around the centromeres that
                            are known to mainly aid in chromosomal segregation and the other exclusively at the
                            chromosomal arms to facilitate genetic recombination events. However, how this
                            distinct cohesin loading pattern is maintained on the chromosomes is not very clear.
                            Potential molecular mechanisms mediated by chromatin receptors and epigenetic
                            factors in dictating this preferential loading in Schizosaccharomyces pombe will be
                            discussed.

                              <p class="description">
                                Insect herbivory is a major biotic stress that plants have to encounter. The
                                common cutworm, Spodoptera litura (Fab.), is a major generalist agricultural pest
                                worldwide with a broad host range. However, little is known about the mechanisms
                                used by Spodoptera for a successful invasion of a large set of host plants. The
                                broad host range of the herbivore is due to its ability to downregulate plant
                                immunity across different plants. Insect oral secretion (OS) is derived from gut,
                                labial, mandibular and ventral eversible glands, which are deposited on plants
                                while feeding. It contains an array of Herbivore Associated Molecular Patterns
                                (HAMPs)/elicitors and effectors, which either elicit or suppress plant defense
                                reactions.

                                With increased growth of cancer cells in a tumour, nutrients become limiting,
thereby invoking cancer-specific adaptive strategies for survival. These metabolic
vulnerabilities not only help us understand the regulatory aspects of metabolism but
also make them potential targets for therapy. Our previous data showed that breast
cancer cells actively scavenge acetate as an alternate nutrient source through an
enzyme, Acetyl-CoA Synthetase 2, and this flux increases upon metabolic stress.
Most of the exogenous acetate is used up in lipogenesis, with very little contributing
towards histone acetylation. <br><a target="_blank" href="" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#Modal4">Read more </a>

pathologies as their removal by genetic or pharmacological means, as well as
possibly by exercise, improves the outcome in animal models. An alternative to
depleting such cells would be to rejuvenate them to promote their return to a
replicative state. The means to do so have not been explored, but here we report
that treatment of non-growing senescent cells with low-frequency ultrasound (LFU)

                                            Synapses are hotspots for learning and memory and can be extremely complex.
They possess diverse morphologies, receptor types, ion channels, and second
messengers. The differences between synaptic designs across brain areas
suggest a link between synaptic form and function. In the tiny spaces of a synapse,
often only a few molecules are needed to orchestrate function. This makes
measurements at a synapse difficult.

            candidate-based and forward-genetic screening approaches in the embryonic
            stem cell (ESC) model to investigate the temporospatial cell-fate modulation by
            genetic and epigenetic players. Since developmental regulation is multi-factorial,
            we have also explored the cross-talk among various factors in specifying the
            specific cell fates. Our work suggests the crucial and differential influence of Wnt
            signalling and its crosstalk with other modulators dictating the “to be or not to be”
            state of cells during lineage specification and further differentiation.
            While canonical Wnt activation at the early stage of ESCs’
            differentiation directs mesoderm induction, it eventually
            sets up hematoendothelial differentiation at the expense of
            the cardiomyogenic programme. We have further
            demonstrated that a deubiquitinase (DUB/USP) acting as
            a Wnt target and via histone deubiquitination dictates this
            differential fate modulation. I will discuss the ongoing
            research pursuits in my laboratory concerning the drivers

            factors in dictating this preferential loading in Schizosaccharomyces pombe will be
            discussed.  
            The need to have such a distinct occupancy for different
            complexes across the chromosomes is also unknown. Our work
            had previously shown that the pericentric-specific cohesin complex
            actively represses meiotic double-strand break formation and,
            consequently, crossovers at the centromeres. Importantly, there is
            a strong correlation between centromeric crossovers and
            chromosomal mis-segregation events leading to infertility and
            developmental disorders such as Down syndrome in humans. The
            molecular details of how centromeric crossovers result in
            chromosomal mis-segregation remains largely unexplored, and our
            work on deciphering these mechanisms will be discussed. In
            addition, we will discuss how the occurrence and distinct
            localization patterns of the mitotic and meiotic paralogs of cohesin
            protein subunits differentially affect their recombination and
            segregation functions during cell division.

            science of ecology and human dimensions of conservation that have led to the
            current practices of conservation in the high mountains of Asia.  
            I will introduce the ecology of high Asia, its major flora and
            fauna, and discuss the challenges to their preservation
            with examples of area-based, community-based, market-
            based, and ecosystem services-based approaches to
            conservation. Here, the key questions to discuss are: how
            many snow leopards are there in the world? And does it
            matter? Is livestock grazing – the predominant land use in
            this region – beneficial or harmful for snow leopard
            conservation? How should we relate to the snow leopard
            (to nature in general)? I will confront some of the

Good intentions of doing good research are not necessarily going to give good results. Even the means have to justify the ends. During the second World War, the Nazi crimes on Jewish prisoners came to light. These ‘human experiments’ were inhuman practices in the name of research. The healthcare practitioners involved in these experiments were tried in an international court of law, now famously known as the Nuremberg Trials . Since there were no prior laws or framework for research, research ethics principles were enunciated as outcome of trial. Thus came the Nuremberg Code in practice of research and it upheld 3 principles of voluntary informed consent, risk benefit analysis and voluntary withdrawal from the research without fear of facing negative consequences.

          Based on de-novo transcriptome data in S. litura,
808 and 267 proteins from the head and salivary
gland, respectively, were predicted as potential
secreted proteins with possible effector functions.
We also used an independent proteomics approach
to identify secretory proteins. We will discuss
different examples of insect-released proteins and
their function in immune response modulation.

            the wildtype ancestor also showed cell shape plasticity, it was
            either assimilated or reversed after evolution. I demonstrate that
            phenotypic plasticity can simultaneously evolve in opposite
            directions across multiple distinct levels of biological
            organization (single cells versus cell collectives). I also show

            phenotypic plasticity in this evolutionary transition. I also show
            that a high-level phenotype can be genetically assimilated by
            the expression of contrasting lower-level phenotypes. Taken

            Our research provides structural insights into the key
checkpoints shared in the committed steps of primary (i.e., leucine) and
specialized (i.e., glucosinolate) metabolic pathways, which can be extrapolated to
selectively manipulate nutritionally favoured metabolites in crop plants.
On the translation side, we recently reported
CRISPR/Cas9-based editing of glucosinolate
transporter (GTR) family genes in the Indian oilseed
mustard (Brassica juncea) to develop ideal lines with
the desired low seed glucosinolate content while
maintaining high glucosinolate levels in the other plant
parts for uncompromised plant defense. Our result
presents a breakthrough in the breeding of oilseed
Brassicas for oil and seed-meal quality without
compromising the protection provided by
glucosinolates to all the vegetative parts of the plant.

            leads to the downregulation of key genes required for stamen
