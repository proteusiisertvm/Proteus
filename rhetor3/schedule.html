                                   factors that makes any species or habitat conservation successful with the help of an ethical
                                   framework. As pretty as it appears, working in the conservation world is equally challenging.
                                   Conservationists face difficulties of accessibility, time, weather, etc. In such a working

        <t style="font-size:20px"> I present an overview of what is known so far about the relevance and possible role for quantum mechanical phenomena like coherence and entanglement in the context of biological systems. The length and time scales that are typical to quantum mechanics is vastly different from the length and time scales at which biological processes occur. This makes it a-priori unlikely that quantum effects are relevant for understanding biological processes. However the efficiencies and sensitivities that are found in phenomena like photosynthesis and avian magneto-reception are not easy to explain using just the laws of classical physics. There is increasing evidence that certain molecules and multi-molecular structures that have key roles in these biological processes may actually be optimised in a rather subtle way that it helps preserve the quantum effects that can explain the high efficiencies and sensitivities. I briefly touch upon some recent results on how such structured molecular environments may preserve or even enhance quantum coherence in molecular energy and electron transfer processes.

        <t style="font-size:20px"> Zinc (Zn) is considered as a most limiting factor in producing crops at different parts of the world. Up to 95% of applied Zn micronutrient never reach their targets and are wasted besides causing collateral damages. Improving the uptake of Zn in plants is therefore necessary for minimizing biotic stress and enhancing yield. A novel approach that has received increased research attention in recent years is nanoparticles (NPs) mediated nutrient delivery. NP has properties that are very different from its bulk form. It can be designed to retain all advantages of the bulk form and in addition possess properties that would help to reduce the effective concentration and ensure its application as effective micronutrients. In the recent years, many studies have shown that therapeutic NPs can penetrate leaves and deliver nutrient to agricultural crops. Also, increasing use of zinc nanoparticles (Zn NPs) in various commercial products is prompting detailed investigation.
        While, ZnO NP is known to have plant growth promoting properties, ZnS NP is less explored. ZnS is a naturally occurring salt and the main source of Zn found in nature. The nano form of ZnS is widely used nanomaterial among the different semiconductors. They are used in biological applications as tagging molecules, pharmaceuticals, cosmetic and rubber industries and in paint. ZnS NP is nontoxic and more stable in nature than other semiconductors. It has a wider band gap value than large sized ZnS and ZnO NP. Because of these properties, nZnS can be used in both biomedical and optoelectronic applications.
        Therefore, the main goal of our study was to elucidate the use of ZnS NP in agriculture as fertilizer and its mechanism which could enrich the soil and plant with optimal Zn and improve crop health and productivity. In our study, ZnS NP treatment at low concentration significantly changes the nutritional status of the mungbean plant, promoted plant growth and photosynthesis. Electron microscopic study confirmed the uptake and translocation of ZnS NP. Treatment concentrations did not show any oxidative stress rather displayed improved antioxidant activity. Our study confirmed that ZnS NP has potential to be used as a micronutrient for plant growth. Our investigation demonstrated the concept of nano- micronutrient or nano-fertilizer as well as phytotoxicity by understanding ZnS NPs–plant interactions.

        <t style="font-size:20px"> Research – a perpetual feedback process – improves treatments, finds cures and betters living. Good intentions of doing good research are not necessarily going to give good results. Even the means have to justify the ends. During the second World War, the Nazi crimes on Jewish prisoners came to light. These ‘human experiments’ were inhuman practices in the name of research. The healthcare practitioners involved in these experiments were tried in an international court of law, now famously known as the Nuremberg Trials . Since there were no prior laws or framework for research, research ethics principles were enunciated as outcome of trial. Thus came the Nuremberg Code in practice of research and it upheld 3 principles of voluntary informed consent, risk benefit analysis and voluntary withdrawal from the research without fear of facing negative consequences.
        <br>
        This set stage for Ethics review committees to review research. Around
        1960, the use of thalidomide to prevent morning sickness resulted in
        congenital anomalies in new born. The public outcry resulted in mandatory
        informed consent when an investigational new drug was being tried.
        <br>
        The principles in health care slowly changed from beneficence to autonomy (self-determination). Although regulatory frameworks in different countries are revising their guidelines to include the cutting edge research and to elaborate the process of consent, there are local socio-demographic
        Medical Research (ICMR) brought out revised guidelines in 2017 keeping in times with the changing research milieu and another guideline specific to COVID 19 research. The New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules 2019 brought out by CDSCO (attached to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940) lays down guidelines for clinical trials, bioavailablity/bioequivalence studies and functioning of ethics committees 6 . This presentation will elucidate key ethical issues in biomedical research focusing on ethics of health technology assessment.

Such disordered regions are also defined by substantial conformational plasticity. Many such proteins are functional, however, some form ordered aggregates in pathological condition, a marker for many neurogenerative diseases. Therefore, disorder to order structural transition is fascinating as well as challenging. NMR spectroscopy provides an unique opportunity to study the intrinsically dynamic nature of the disordered proteins. Here,
        I will be presenting our ongoing work on two major proteins, Tau and CPEB3, former forming pathological aggregates and latter forming functional aggregates. Abnormal aggregation of the intrinsically disordered protein tau is implied in many diseases, which are collectively called tauopathies. Our focus is on identifying the different aggregation mechanism of tau protein responsible for producing the multiple fibril structures associated with different tauopathies. The N-terminal domain of CPEB3 is a low complexity domain, whose prion nature is responsible for maintaining long-term memory in mammals. Therefore, studying the structural transition of the prion domain should help in targeting the aggregation of CPEB3 very effectively. In working with these two diverse protein we hope to correlate their aggregation process with their functional or pathological activity.

        <t style="font-size:20px">Nerve cells are early adopters of digital communication, sending electrical pulses called Action Potentials down their axons to communicate with other cells. Hodgkin and Huxley showed in the middle of the last century that the Action Potential is generated by the movement of ions across neuronal cell membrane. The cell membrane is oil-like and presents an insurmountable barrier to the movement of ions like Na+, K+ or Ca++.  Channels are essentially water-filled tunnels across the membrane that ions can freely diffuse through. Cells maintain gradients of many solutes across their membranes and free movement across the membrane would collapse these gradients. So channels are open only in response to specific stimuli. Hodgkin and Huxley postulated that the currents involved in generating the Action Potential in neurons are regulated by membrane potential.
        <br>
        We now know that the ion channels involved in the Action Potential are ion selective - they pass only Na+ or K+, for instance - and open and close in response to changes in membrane potential.
        <br>
        The first ion channel to be understood in molecular detail is the Voltage-Gated Potassium channel. Genes encoding these proteins were cloned in the 1980’s and analysis of the sequences of the proteins showed that they were tetramers, the polypeptide chain comprising each monomer crossing the membrane 6 times. It soon became possible to express them in cells that do not normally have such channels. This allowed us to study the proteins without having to purify them. The principal approach was to record currents through the channels in response to changes in electrical potential. By changing specific residues in the protein it became possible to map different functions of the protein on to specific stretches of the sequence. For instance, the fourth segment to span the membrane is positively charged and it was shown that this element served to sense the voltage across the membrane. The portion that lined the aqueous pore was also identified. It remained to elucidate how movement of the voltage sensor was transduced into channel opening and closing. This required knowledge of the 3 dimensional structure of the protein.
        <br>
        Rod MacKinnon’s group crystallised a series of K+ channels and determined their structures at atomic resolution. Based on these structures we built up a model of how changes in electric field across the membrane resulted in changes in the structure of the protein leading to channel opening or closing. The model was tested by mutagenesis and electrophysiology and has been found to explain most of the published data on voltage gated ion channels. We have thus identified the nuts and bolts of the machinery that underlies electrical signalling in the nervous system.
